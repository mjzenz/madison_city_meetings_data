# Madison WI City Meetings Vote Tracker

This project extracts, processes, and summarizes voting records from Madison City meeting minutes. It produces a database of votes, including who voted and how they voted on each item.

This project was heavily written by Cursor agent + claude-3.5-sonnet. It has undergone some quality checking but there are still some loose ends to tie up. I welcome data problems reported as Github issues. 

The repo currently contains a DuckDB database file containing voting records for Common Council meetings from 2023 through the May 6, 2025 meeting. The other elements of the processing pipeline are not pushed to Github at the moment. 

## Processing Pipeline

The project consists of several scripts that work in a sequence:

1. `scraper.py`: Downloads meeting minutes PDFs from Madison's Legistar system
   - Fetches PDFs of all city meetings in Legistar (paginates through API results to avoid the 1000-record default limit)
   - Saves them to `downloaded_minutes/` directory

2. `organize_minutes.py`: Organizes the downloaded PDFs
   - Replaces spaces with underscores in filenames
   - Creates meeting-type folders
   - Moves PDFs to appropriate folders with date-based names
   - End result here is folders with all city committees with PDFs of meeting minutes.

3. `extract_votes.py`: Processes a single PDF to extract voting data
   - Parses PDF text to find vote records
   - Extracts vote counts, member names, and motion details
   - Creates summary and detailed CSV files for each meeting
   - This is optimized for Common Council at the moment. It's possible the structure generalizes but I haven't tried yet.

4. `process_all_pdfs.py`: Batch processes multiple PDFs
   - Loops through all PDFs in the Common Council folder
   - Calls `extract_votes.py` for each PDF
   - Handles errors and provides progress updates

5. `combine_and_load.py`: Creates and populates the database
   - Combines all CSV files from processed PDFs
   - Creates DuckDB database with tables and views
   - Loads all voting data into the database

6. `fetch_alders.py`: Fetches alder (council member) data from Legistar API
   - Downloads council member records including district, term dates, contact info
   - Downloads committee membership records for each alder
   - Saves to `alders.csv` and `alder_committees.csv`
   - Run `python combine_and_load.py --alders-only` to load into database

7. `query_votes.py`: Streamlit app to query the database
   - Simple query editor to write queries against the database
   - This is just a simple way to interact with the DuckDB rather than interactively in a python console or something

## Database Structure

The data is stored in a DuckDB database (`madison_votes.db`) with the following structure:

### Tables
- `votes_summary`: Contains summary information for each vote
- `votes_by_member`: Contains individual voting records for each council member
- `alders`: Dimension table of council members with district, term dates, and contact info
- `alder_committees`: Committee membership records for each alder

### Views
- `votes_with_voters`: Combines vote summaries with lists of who voted which way
- `non_unanimous_votes`: Shows all non-unanimous votes with vote counts
- `member_voting_patterns`: Summary of votes by council member
- `current_alders`: Currently serving council members (filtered by end_date)
- `current_committee_assignments`: Current committee assignments joined with alder info
- `votes_with_alder_info`: Votes joined with alder district and term info

## Data Format

Each vote record includes:
- Meeting date
- Item number and motion number
- Motion title and type
- Legistar reference number and link
- Vote counts (ayes, noes, abstentions, etc.)
- Lists of council members for each vote type (aye, no, abstain, etc.)

## Usage

### Processing New Minutes

To process new meeting minutes:

```bash
# 1. Download new PDFs
python scraper.py

# 2. Organize the PDFs
python organize_minutes.py

# 3. Process all PDFs
python process_all_pdfs.py

# 4. Update the database
python combine_and_load.py
```

### Updating Alder Data

To refresh alder and committee membership data from Legistar:

```bash
# Fetch alder and committee data from API
python fetch_alders.py

# Load into database (without reprocessing votes)
python combine_and_load.py --alders-only
```

### Querying the Data

1. Launch the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run query_votes.py
```

2. Or query the database directly:
```python
import duckdb
db = duckdb.connect('madison_votes.db')
result = db.execute("""
    SELECT * FROM votes_with_voters
    WHERE NOT is_unanimous
    ORDER BY meeting_date DESC
""").fetchdf()
```

3. Example alder queries:
```sql
-- Current council members by district
SELECT full_name, district, start_date, end_date
FROM current_alders ORDER BY district;

-- Committee assignments for each alder
SELECT full_name, district, COUNT(*) as committees
FROM current_committee_assignments
GROUP BY full_name, district ORDER BY district;

-- Voting patterns by district
SELECT district, vote_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM votes_with_alder_info
WHERE NOT is_unanimous AND district IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY district, vote_type ORDER BY district;
```

## Data Sources

The voting data is extracted from official Madison City Council meeting minutes PDFs, which are publicly available through the City of Madison's legislative information system (Legistar).

## Note

PDF and CSV files are not included in the repository to keep it lightweight. The processed data is available in the DuckDB database file.
